# Performance
[Google Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en) was used to test the performance of the website. The website's performance received relatively lower scores, primarily due to its extensive use of images. However, the accessibility, adherence to best practices, and SEO aspects consistently received high scores.

# Accessibility
[The WAVE WebAIM](https://wave.webaim.org) web accessibility evaluation tool to check if the website meets strong accessibility standards.
As a result, I've identified several areas where I can work on improving the website's accessibility. Specifically, there are some contrast errors related to buttons that need enhancements to improve color contrast. Additionally, there are issues related to alerts, where links lead to the same page. These areas need my attention to make the website more user-friendly and accessible, ensuring a better experience for all visitors.

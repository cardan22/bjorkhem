Generated a `sitemap.xml` file using XML Sitemaps to enhance site navigation for search engines and accelerate content discovery.

**Creating a robots.txt file**
Developed a robots.txt file to guide search engines on which directories to exclude from crawling and indexing. Additionally, the file includes a link to the sitemap, signaling a level of quality to search engines and thereby improving SEO ranking.
